First of all c++11 random number are used which are truely random so output can vary sometime.


Their is a cons LOW_FUEL_LIMIT in myHelperFunctio.h which define the low fuel limit of plane.
By increasing its value =>
	1: Less chances of crashing
	2: Less landing waiting time
	3: Greater take off waiting time.


Crash possibility only left when too many planes came of same dead line fuel arrives (i.e 3) plus we already have some plane in queue of same dead line fuel.
This fact can only b handled by increasing the low_fuel_limit. Because in that case it does not wait for last time unit and let the plane land well before its dead line time
But due to this on the other hand the time of take off quque increased.
